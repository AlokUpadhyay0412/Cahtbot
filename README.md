🗣️ Personal Digital Assistant: Voice-Controlled Automation for Everyday Tasks
🎙️ Overview
Welcome to your very own Personal Digital Assistant! This script transforms your desktop into an intuitive, voice-controlled assistant that listens, understands, and performs actions for you. Whether it's playing your favorite music, opening apps, or answering your questions via an AI chatbot, this assistant is ready to help.

✨ Features
- Open Your Favorite Websites: Just say the word, and your assistant will open commonly visited sites like YouTube, Google, Instagram, and more.
- Music on Demand: Got a song in mind? Simply ask your assistant to play it from your local library.
- Current Time Updates: Curious about the time? No need to look—just ask!
- Application Control: Open essential applications like Mail, WhatsApp, VLC, and more with voice commands.
- Chatbot Integration: Need some quick info or conversation? Ask the assistant to "answer my question" and it will launch a chatbot.

- Custom Commands: Easily expand the script to suit your needs by adding more websites, songs, and apps!

🛠️ How It Works

   - Open a specific website.
   - Play a song from the predefined library.
   - Launch a desktop application.
   - Tell you the time.
   - Connect to a chatbot for complex queries.
4. Friendly Voice Feedback: The assistant uses text-to-speech to keep you informed about what it's doing.
